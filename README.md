# Base And Comparisons

This module works on finding The base and Compare it to other id's. This is not yet done untill we can 
create another relationship for other id's like 51 or 52.

# How to use

Run this query in the Neo4j query browser.

#Notice

If you notice about the query, there is some with this type (#) like (:#another relationship).
This is because we are not done yet on creating another relationship to compare. This simply means
that this is for another relationship.
